# FinalProject
 
Why are we doing this?
We are doing this as part of our learning and final assessment here at QA software bootcamp, the challenge is to create a Spring Boot API project with the context of our own such as a hobby, business, etc. This will showcase all the knowledge that we have gained since the start of this bootcamp and how we utilised it in this very work.  ALl the fundamentals that we have learnt are put to the test to see how much we have been able to use. 
 
 
How I expected the challenge to go?
I expected the challenge to be difficult but not so difficult that i cannot do the task. As a beginner there are many things that I am still learning and one of them is creating better work. My knowledge is quite limited which can affect how I perform on this project. An example of this is when I did not know how to use a Jira board or push to the dev branch on GitHub. Despite being familiar with eclipse, github etc and their usage,I still have gaps that I need to fill. The order in how things are done was something I found challenging even though a demo of its exact copy was covered last week. I am however working to the best of my abilities to complete it .
 
What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
What went well was that the code was able to run and that I was able to fix bugs that would disrupt the work. Being able to apply the knowledge that I have used throughout the weeks using it to solve issues I run into during this period. Although I still have a lot to learn, I’m glad with the outcome of the work done. WHat didn’t go as planned was not completing all the tasks, most are done but there are a few I wasn’t able to complete due to computer issues.
 
 
Possible improvements for future revisions of the project?
Managing my tasks better and ensuring that I do not spend more time planned on it as it affects other tasks that are just as important. Another improvement for future projects is ensuring that I repair and fix the issue with my computer as it is slow. This has impacted the project quite heavily however I am managing and hope to complete it before the deadline. If repairing doesn't fix the issue then purchasing one would solve the issue as everything is being delayed with a slow computer. One lesson that I've learned is that covering topics outside of the classroom content is important, as this expands on your already existing knowledge. Plus in the classroom the majority is covered however not everything is. Independent learning is what I would like to improve on as well, especially being new to the tech field/space. This learning experience has taught me that.
